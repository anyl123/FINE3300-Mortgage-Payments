FINE3300 (Winter 2025): Assignment 1 - Mortgage Payments

This assignment will involve me writing a program that calculates the monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, rapid bi-weekly, weekly, and rapid weekly amounts based on the user input. I am tasked with writing a function named mortgage payments that takes three parameters: named principal, rate, and amortization. 

The program will prompt the user to enter the principal amount, the quoted interest rate, and the amortization period in years. It will return a tuple of six values representing the monthly, semi-monthly, bi- weekly, weekly, rapid bi-weekly, and rapid weekly payments.
